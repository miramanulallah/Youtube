# YouTube Focus Workspace (v1.5)

The internet is designed for consumption, not mastery. This workspace is a high-performance environment built to flip that script. It transforms YouTube from a passive distraction into an intentional learning engine using the power of **Google Gemini 3 Flash**.

## 🚀 Deep Learning Features

### 1. Intentional Protocol (The Gatekeeper)
*   **Purpose-Driven Access:** Playback is locked until you define a learning objective.
*   **AI Evaluation:** Gemini 3 Flash analyzes your intent to ensure it aligns with the video content, categorizing your session (e.g., "Skill Acquisition," "Deep Theory") before unlocking.
*   **Voice Integration:** State your intent hands-free using the integrated microphone system.

### 2. Neural Workspace (The Sidekick)
*   **Multi-Modal Chat:** A specialized AI Assistant that lives alongside your video. It knows the video context and your live notes, answering questions based on your specific session.
*   **One-Click Synthesis:** Instantly generate Study Plans, Active Recall Quizzes, or Executive Summaries from your messy drafts.
*   **Contextual Persistence:** All drafts and AI insights are tied to specific video IDs, so your work is never lost when you switch sessions.

### 3. Voice-to-Knowledge Pipeline
*   **Seamless Transcription:** Integrated audio processing in the Intent Protocol, Draft Editor, and AI Chat.
*   **High Fidelity:** Uses Gemini's native audio-to-text capabilities to capture technical terms and complex reasoning.

### 4. Zero-Distraction Player
*   **Sanitized UI:** All YouTube noise (comments, recommendations, ads, related videos) is completely stripped away.
*   **Custom Controls:** Frame-accurate seeking, custom playback speed indicators, and responsive HTML5 range controls.
*   **Cinema & Focus Mode:** Toggle the workspace sidebar for a pure, distraction-free viewing experience.
*   **Focus Timer:** Real-time tracking of active learning periods to quantify your productivity.

### 5. Collection & Library Management
*   **Smart History:** Automatically fetches actual creator-defined titles and channel metadata via the YouTube IFrame API.
*   **Custom Playlists:** Build and manage collections of focused content without needing a YouTube account.
*   **Watch Later:** A dedicated queue for videos you intend to process in future deep sessions.

### 6. Data Integrity & Portability
*   **Local-First:** All data (history, notes, playlists) is stored securely in your browser's local storage.
*   **Export/Import:** Backup your entire workspace to a `JSON` file for archival or migration to other devices.
